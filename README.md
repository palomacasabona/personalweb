# ðŸŒ¸ About me ðŸŒ¸
<h2>Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹</h2> 

I'm Paloma,a web developer and programmer <strong>in process</strong>. I am passionate about sciences and technologies since my childhood, as I consider myself being very curious about everything, I love to explore and accomplish new challenges. Currently learning by myself, with online tutorials, some courses done in different platforms. 

ðŸ˜ƒ I'm very excited and completely overwhelmed by this new field/world I am discovering with the help of some of my friends. I can not wait to learn more and more about this endless IT world. So I can say that I am very aware of the lastest technologies, I follow some of the most active programmers in some of my social media (LinkedIn & Twitter), and feel very motivated to learn new tools and languages to be on the top of this infinite field.
